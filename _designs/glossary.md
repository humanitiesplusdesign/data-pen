Verify/Strongly Identify
   : To add a URI to a string or unique controlled string, making it a potent and potentially linked data point. We **verify** a literal to make it an entity. For Fibra the term is used most often when we lookup a value in an Authority and then verify against the Authority. This could also happen by matching a value to an Archive source that includes already verified entities. 

Layers
   : In the Construct application, the graph interface we will use layers to contain entity types. For each entity type defined, a layer is added. We use layers to manage the complexity. The default being to show one entity type at a time. Layers can also be thought of as planes. Each plane has a different entity type. Links between entities will almost certainly cross planes.
