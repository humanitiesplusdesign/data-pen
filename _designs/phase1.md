In Phase 1 we are going to focus efforts on importing a single entity from a Linked Data store. We will work out the challenges of querying, presenting the ontology to users, and making selection/addition clean, elegant and intuitive.

The chart below shows where this step fits within the required set of tasks and functionalities with existing tools.

The reasoning behind this focus is that while all of the outlined tasks are in the end necessary, there already exist reasonably adequate tools for most of these tasks, when done in bulk and in a manner focused on just one of them in turn.

However, when locally exploring data, these activities need to be much more fluidly integrated to support the end goal of being able to think through the data. This is also why, while there are tools for some of the individual local tasks, they are not adequate for our goal.
