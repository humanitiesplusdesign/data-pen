In Phase 1 we are going to focus efforts on importing a single entity from a Linked Data store. We will work out the challenges of querying, presenting the ontology to users, and making selection/addition clean, elegant and intuitive. We've identified three components that will be necessary for Phase 1: Configure, Explore, and Enrich.

The chart below shows where our Phase 1 fits within the required set of tasks and functionalities with existing tools.

![Chart/matrix for Fibra development]({{site.urlimg}}{{page.collection}}/Fibra_planning.001.png)

The reasoning behind this focus is that while all of the outlined tasks are in the end necessary, there already exist reasonably adequate tools for most of these tasks, when done in bulk and in a manner focused on just one of them in turn.

However, when locally exploring data, these activities need to be much more fluidly integrated to support the end goal of being able to think through the data. This is also why, while there are tools for some of the individual local tasks, they are not adequate for our goal.

# Components

1. CONFIGURE

  * Select Archives
  * Choose which you want to use and set limits.
  * Select Authorities
  * Set authorities for default entity types
  * Select from Imported data
  * Include EDA charts to give a shape of the data

2. EXPLORE

  * add nodes and links to the canvas
  * group nodes
  * change the layout
  * apply weight to nodes and edges to see network measures

3. ENRICH

  * Enrich entities from linked sources by selecting based on an overview of availble data
  * How much information is available about these entities? (sortable tabular heat map)
  * What of that available information am I seeing?
  * Show what is not available, too
       1. Entities that do not have an associated date
       2. Enitities associated to the entities in my query result that donâ€™t have a date.

# Case studies #

## Procope
Procope is an example of a dataset generated by scholars based on existing resources. We will deconstruct some of the process behind Procope as a model for looking up entities in authorities and pulling in data from the services listed below.   
The [Procope](http://demo.seco.tkk.fi/saha/project/index.shtml?model=procope) database includes letter data from [Electronic Enlightenment](http://www.e-enlightenment.com/) and the [D'Alembert](http://dalembert.academie-sciences.fr/) corpus, as well as person categorization data by researchers at Stanford.

Of particular interest to us:
 * Overlapping data of the same type with EMLO
 * Additional person categorization data of the type we want to support in creating

## Archive sources
### Early Modern Correspondence

Based on [EMLO](http://demo.seco.tkk.fi/saha/project/index.shtml?model=emlo) we will limit query to one of the following three entity types:
 * Person
 * Place
 * Letter

Of particular interest to us:
 * Rich modeling of dates using CIDOC-CRM, including different types of uncertainty
 * Well thought out data model
 * The EMLO database also contains rich prosopographical data in a rich event-based model to expand to.

### Six Degrees of Francis Bacon

Using the [Linked Data conversion](http://demo.seco.tkk.fi/saha/project/index.shtml?model=sdfb) of the [original database](http://www.sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/).

Of particular interest to us:
 * Single object type (people), but rich relations with attendant source and confidence annotations (=complex model for relationships)

### Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts

The [Linked Data conversion](http://demo.seco.tkk.fi/saha/project/index.shtml?model=shoenberg) ([data model](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1lZHqRw_rFlbnWytL6olSXE-mKS2HJqic5debjH7__bw/edit)) of the [Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts](http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/schoenberg/index.html) contains rich information on the passage of books through auctions and owners.

Of particular interest to us:
 * Event-based data model with two different, but connected types of events: transition events such as auctions and donations, as well as possession events

## Authorities

### GeoNames

http://www.geonames.org/

The GeoNames geographical database covers all countries and contains over eight million placenames.

 * SPARQL endpoint: http://ldf.fi/geonames/sparql

### Getty ULAN

http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/index.html

The ULAN includes proper names or anonymous appellations (e.g., Master of the Aachen Altar), biographies, related people or corporate bodies, and other information about artists, architects, firms, studios, museums, special collections, patrons, donors, sitters, creating cultures (e.g., unknown Etruscan), and other people and groups involved in the creation, distribution, collection, maintenance, and study of art and architecture.

 * SPARQL endpoint: http://vocab.getty.edu/

### Library of Congress Names

http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names

The Library of Congress Name Authority File (NAF) file provides authoritative data for names of persons, organizations, events, places, and titles.

 * SPARQL endpoint: http://ldf.fi/lcnames/sparql

### Virtual International Authority File

# Tool design

## Remote endpoint configuration

 * Configure remote endpoints to source data from
 * Load/save ready made configurations
 * Select classes to show/hide
 * Select properties to globally hide (globally/by class?)
 * Change display order of properties?

## Local schema configuration
 * Filter/change display order of properties
 * Select classes to show/hide?

## Main view
 * Class tree view / Faceted query / Text query view
 * Result list+edit view / table view / graphical+edit view

## Bulk edit actions
 * Change values to resources (e.g. convert all *birth places* to instances of Location)
 * Extract properties (e.g. convert all references to *Author* or *Scholar* in the generic *tags* to *occupation* properties)
