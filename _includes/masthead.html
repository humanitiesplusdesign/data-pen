            <p>The data schema is a description of the author's data model. It is both a guide to understanding the values in a data set and a model that may be applied to other data sets. For example, the data schema John Locke's correspondence network might also be applied to the correspondence of Thomas Hobbes or Ren√© Descartes. We consider the data schema an essential research product which, by itself, expresses the design of the research inquiry while also supporting effective data sharing, discovery and analysis.</p>
