The goal of the workshop is to outline the steps necessary to incorporate data editing and entity reconciliation into Palladio components. We will also begin planning a refining of the interface to emphasize layouts for spatial organization of data.



#Agenda

## Tuesday, May 31: The State of Things

9:00-11:00 **Groundwork for Fibra**

1. Review the proposal
2. State of Palladio & where Fibra fits in/does not fit

11:00-12:00 **LD4P and Fibra**

Bess Sadler, Manager for Application Development, and others from the Digital Library Systems and Services team at Stanford University Libraries will come for a discussion about LD4P and Fibra to explore how Fibra can best integrate with future Library infrastructure."

## Wednesday, June 1: Use Cases and Case Studies

10:30-12:30 **Cataloging and Context**

From archive processing to research engagement: The Harrison Papers ([About the collection](http://tinyurl.com/harrison-papers))  

The Stanford University Library recently completed the grant-funded acquisition of The Helen and Newton Harrison Papers. The collection includes a wide range of materials including born-digital files and email accounts.  

Glynn Edwards, who led both the archive project and the development of a [discovery tool for email](http://epadd.stanford.edu/epadd/collections), will share the Library's perspective on processing a complex archive like this for research access. We will then hear from Laura Rogers, a PhD candidate in Modern Thought and Literature who began working with the Harrison Papers while the collection was being processed. This overlap in aquisition and research provides an opportunity to see how a collection is modeled for the Library and how a researcher models the same collection through metadata.

12:30-1:30 Lunch

2:00-4:00

**Matthew Lincoln @ CESTA Graduate Research Fellows meeting**  
**Linked Open Realities: The Joys and Pains of Using Linked Data for Research**

Tim Berners Lee painted a picture of an interoperable, online semantic web of knowledge in 1999... and we're all still waiting for it. For infrastructural engineers, a fluid exchange of semantically-meaningful statements between disparate sources seems as distant as ever. But for a researcher getting their hands dirty in data for research, linked data concepts and formats have real uses today. This presentation will explore examples of cultural heritage linked data in art historical research, focusing on benefits as well as pain points in trying to discover, search, download, and interconnect.
